One particular run of the "sudoku_bench" binary:

Each implementation is run ITER (currently at 100) times and the average between these runs is displayed in the terminal.
The measurements are expressed is nanoseconds.
For each input board, the measurements are done in two different ways:
1) The total time spent to solve ONLY a number of ITER boards, divided by ITER value -> The time spent to solve ONLY one board
2) The time spent to read the board, check its validity and to solve it. 
It is run ITER times and the resulting time amount is divided by ITER.
Obviosly, this number will be higher considering the same implementation for the same board.

This input is copied to a file and a python script generates two plots for it.
  1) solver_only.png  -> boards from "Solver Only - ..."
  2) full_run.png     -> boards from "Full Run - ..." (includes invalid boards)

X axis: boards (discrete, in first-seen order *per plot*)
Y axis: time in ns/iter
Each algorithm is represented by one line.

To use the script:

  python3 plot_bench.py --in bench.txt --outdir plots --logy
  cat bench.txt | python3 plot_bench.py --outdir plots



Observations:

1) solver_only.png 
- The pattern is identical for all the optimizations, there being 2 spikes
- A good performance was made by the optimized version 2 - the Bitmask approach
- The next one in terms of performance is the optimized version 4 - Loop unrolling 
- The third one is the optimized version 3 - Cache optimizations 
- The fourth place is taken by the optimized version 1 - Combined loops 
- The fifth place is optimized version 5 - Lookup table 
- The last two places are shared between the optimized version 0 and the unoptimized version.
Surprinsigly, the optimized version 0 doesn't have a clear overall performance over the unoptimized one.
For this particular measurement, the optimized version 0 performs better than the unoptimized version for the "Solvable 2x Hard" board, but 
for the rest of the boards the performance is lower or almost equal in the best case.

2) full_run.png 
- we can observe the pattern is similar with the above plot 

For a better understanding of the differences, I've also generated two additional plots for each case in which for the OY axis the log scale is used.
